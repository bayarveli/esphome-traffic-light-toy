ESPHome traffic light toy
=========================

This is a fun little project - a traffic light toy that can connect to a home
automation system. The idea is to make playtime more exciting while also
sneaking in a bit of learning about traffic rules. Plus, itâ€™s a cool way to
tinker with ESPHome for the first time.

Hardware setup
--------------

Below is the list of components used to build the traffic light toy:

- [ESP32-CAM Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Board][esp_device]:
  The development board used to control the traffic light.

- [Breadboard Power Supply Module (5V and 3.3V][power_supply]:  
  Provides power to the development board and traffic light.

- [LED Traffic Light Module][traffic_light_module]:  
  The traffic light module with red, yellow, and green LEDs.

Refer the wiring diagram on how these components are connected:

Installation & Configuration
----------------------------

On windows, install `esphome` via pip:

```sh

```

Checkout the repository:

```

Find the device as offline with the [traffic light config](traffic-light.yaml)
